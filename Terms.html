        <h2>Thank you for using Bonjour.</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Bonjour. Bonjour is an app to help you make friends in new areas. We hope that Bonjour shows you that there are people who want to connec

            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access and use of our app, website, and other tools (collectively, “Bonjour” or the “Service” or “Services”). Each time you access or use Bonjour, you agree to be bound by these Terms and any additional terms that apply to you. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, please stop using Bonjour. Bonjour is owned and developed by Openup Technologies Inc. (“Company,” “we” or “us”). For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services.
            
            We also have a Privacy Policy that discusses what information we collect and how we use this information. You should read the Privacy Policy because it governs the Company’s use of your personal information.
            
            IMPORTANT NOTE: THE SECTION TITLED “ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW” CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS-ACTION WAIVER THAT APPLIES TO ALL U.S.-BASED BONJOUR USERS. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS EXPLAINED IN THE SECTION TITLED “ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW.”
            </p>              
        <h2>Age and legal capacity</h2>
        <p>You represent that you are at least 17 years of age and possess the legal capacity to enter into the agreement set forth in these Terms. No one under the age of 17 is allowed to use or access Bonjour. If you are old enough to use or access Bonjour but are not old enough to have authority to consent to our terms, your parent or guardian must agree to these Terms on your behalf. If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your teenager to use the services, then these Terms also apply to you and you’re responsible for your teenager’s activity on the services.

            If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may only use Bonjour if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country or if verifiable parental consent for your use of Bonjour has been provided to us.
            </p>
        <h2>Accounts and Software Updates</h2>
        <p>When you create your Bonjour account, you agree that the information you submit is correct and complete. We may refuse you access to the Service if we learn that the information you provided is inaccurate. You may stop using the Services at any time and for any reason. You can delete your Bonjour account by tapping  Profile › Delete Account.

            Using Bonjour requires that we initially download software to your computer, phone, tablet, or other device. You agree that we may automatically update that software, and that these Terms and our policies will apply to any updates.
             </p>
        <h2>Your license to use Bonjour</h2>
        <p>The Services, including their “look and feel” (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos), proprietary content, information, and other materials, and the proprietary software and other technology used to provide the Services are protected under copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You agree that the Company and/or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services (including any and all intellectual property rights therein), and you agree not to take any action(s) inconsistent with such ownership interests. Although we are granting you this license, we and our licensors retain all intellectual property rights we have in our software and Services (other than User Content (defined below)), including, without limitation, the exclusive right to create derivative works.

            The Bonjour name and the Bonjour logo or icon (the “hills” design) and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of the Company or its affiliates or licensors. The unauthorized use of any of these trademarks is strictly prohibited.
            
            Some of our Services allow you to download client software. So long as you comply with these Terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, non-assignable, and revocable license to download, install, and run that software, solely to access our Services.
            
            You may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or Services. You also may not reverse engineer or decompile our software or Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so, unless you have our written consent or applicable law permits it.
            </p>
        <h2>You own what you post</h2>
        <p>
            We refer to the photos, comments, messages, links, and other content you post as "User Content." You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to Bonjour.

While your User Content belongs to you, several important limitations apply:

First, User Content does not include your Bonjour username. Should you or Bonjour terminate your account, you do not retain any rights in the username you used. A new Bonjour user may use the username in the future.

Second, you grant Bonjour and our users a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, store, display, reproduce, save, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute your User Content for the purposes of using, accessing, operating, developing, and providing Bonjour. Nothing in these Terms restricts other legal rights Bonjour may have to User Content, for example under other licenses.

Third, we retain the right to remove or modify User Content or change the way it’s used in Bonjour, for any reason. This includes User Content that, in our judgment, violates these Terms or any other policies.

Fourth, content you share with others on Bonjour may continue to exist on Bonjour even if you leave Bonjour. We may back up, archive, and retain your User Content even if you terminate or deactivate your account or delete or remove specific User Content. Bonjour and its users may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User Content that other users have stored or shared on Bonjour.
